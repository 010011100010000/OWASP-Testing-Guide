==Phase 4: During Deployment==

===Phase 4.1: Application Penetration Testing===

Having tested the requirements, analyzed the design, and performed code review, it might be assumed that all issues have been caught. Hopefully this is the case, but penetration testing the application after it has been deployed provides a last check to ensure that nothing has been missed. 


===Phase 4.2: Configuration Management Testing===

The application penetration test should include the checking of how the infrastructure was deployed and secured. While the application may be secure, a small aspect of the configuration could still be at a default install stage and vulnerable to exploitation.

==Phase 1: Before Development Begins==

===Phase 1.1: Define a SDLC===

Before application development starts an adequate SDLC must be defined where security is inherent at each stage. 


===Phase 1.2: Review Policies and Standards===

Ensure that there are appropriate policies, standards, and documentation in place. Documentation is extremely important as it gives development teams guidelines and policies that they can follow. 

''People can only do the right thing if they know what the right thing is.''' '''''

If the application is to be developed in Java, it is essential that there is a Java secure coding standard. If the application is to use cryptography, it is essential that there is a cryptography standard. No policies or standards can cover every situation that the development team will face. By documenting the common and predictable issues, there will be fewer decisions that need to be made during the development process.


===Phase 1.3: Develop Measurement and Metrics Criteria and Ensure Traceability===

Before development begins, plan the measurement program. By defining criteria that need to be measured, it provides visibility into defects in both the process and product. It is essential to define the metrics before development begins, as there may be a need to modify the process in order to capture the data.

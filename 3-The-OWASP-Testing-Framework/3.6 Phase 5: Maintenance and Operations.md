==Phase 5: Maintenance and Operations==

===Phase 5.1: Conduct Operational Management Reviews===

There needs to be a process in place which details how the operational side of both the application and infrastructure is managed.


===Phase 5.2: Conduct Periodic Health Checks===

Monthly or quarterly health checks should be performed on both the application and infrastructure to ensure no new security risks have been introduced and that the level of security is still intact.


===Phase 5.3: Ensure Change Verification===

After every change has been approved and tested in the QA environment and deployed into the production environment, it is vital that the change is checked to ensure that the level of security has not been affected by the change. This should be integrated into the change management process.
